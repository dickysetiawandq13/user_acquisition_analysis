# **User Acquisition Performance Analysis: Agents vs Influencer - Project Overview**

A fantasy sports platform, established in **2023**, targeting the **Indian market**, where users join **paid contests daily**.

Following the **February crisis**, which caused a significant loss of player trust, the company initiated efforts to **rebuild user confidence and accelerate growth**. As part of this recovery plan, the company explored onboarding a **high-profile influencer** for the first time to evaluate whether her involvement could deliver meaningful business impact despite the high upfront partnership cost.

This project was designed to **test and compare the influencerâ€™s performance against the existing agent acquisition program**, helping guide future decisions on whether to invest further in influencer marketing or continue expanding the agent network through higher cost of partnership.

The analysis was conducted from **March to the end of April 2025** and was actively used in decision-making discussions with the Operations Manager, Finance Lead, and Promotion Coordinator.
